       <p class="text"> 
         Light sleet, freezing drizzle, and wet snowflakes will continue to be possible overnight, likely ending before 5am. As of 8PM, 
         temperatures around the Kingston area are at 32 degrees. Temperatures will likely remain between 30 and 32 degrees overnight. 
         With already wet roads and temperatures now dipping below freezing, areas of black ice are a concern overnight. School delays are 
         possible tomorrow due to the threat of slick roads lingering through sunrise. After sunrise, any icy conditions should
         clear up pretty quickly as temperatures begin to rise above freezing. High termperatures tomorrow will make a run at 40 degrees.
         A round of rain will move in mid-Wednesday afternoon through Thursday night, likely followed by another dose of rain Thursday night. 
         Neither of these next shots of rain pose any snow or ice threats for the mid-Hudson Valley.

      <p class="text">
        A wave of moist weather will impact us this week. This wet weather will be in the form of two phases. The first phase will be in the form of wintery weather 
        Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday. Phase two will be in the form of rain Wednesday afternoon into Thursday. 
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        <span style="color:red; font-size:24px">The Forecast:</span><br>
        A storm currently over the mid-Mississippi River Valley will impact us with wintery precipitation beginning Tuesday. Currently, snow is likely to develop around or
        after 12PM Tuesday. Light snow is likely Tuesday afternoon through about 12AM - 3AM Wednesday night. Snow may mix with sleet and be intermittent at times Tuesday 
        afternoon and  evening. Zero to one inch of snow is likely. Temperatures on Tuesday should reach the mid-30s before falling to near 30 Tuesday night. After a dry Wednesday morning, 
        a second storm will pump rain into the region Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday night. Rain showers will be possible Thursday and into Friday and will be accompanied 
        by warmer temperatures over 10 degrees above normal for this time of year. 
      </p>

       <p class="text">
        <span style="color:red; font-size:24px">The Impacts:</span><br>
         The upcoming storm will result in slick roads Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday night. Much like last Friday's half an inch of snow, accumulations with this storm will not
         be significant, however, the timing will make it somewhat impactful. Afternoon snow tomorrow will make for slick side and untreated streets. However, temperatures during the snow
         tomorrow will be nearly 15 degrees warmer than last week. This means that main roads and roads that have been treated with salt will likely just be wet for most of tomorrow afternoon, 
         but may still become slick as temperatures fall Tuesday night. It woud not be a surprise to see school districts issue early dismissals or even a few cancellations around the mid-Hudson 
         Valley tomorrow. As of right now, delays are possible on Wednesday.
       </p>
