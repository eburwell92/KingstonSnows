        <h2 style="color:red">What is a solar eclipse?</h2>
        A solar eclipse is when the moon passes between the sun and  Earth, blocking part or all of the sun's light from reaching the Earth's surface. If only part of the 
        sun's disk is blocked by the moon, it is called a partial or annular solar eclipse. If all of the sun's disk is blocked by the moon, it is called a total solar eclipse.
        <h2 style="color:red">Why is this eclipse special?</h2>
        This eclipse is only the second total solar eclipse to cross the United States in over 40 years. It will also be the last total solar eclipse to cross the United States until 2045. 
        <h2 style="color:red">What will the eclipse look like?</h2>
        The eclipse will look different depending on where you are located. The map below offers an idea of what the eclipse will look like - IF the sky is not cloudy. 
        In the areas that are colored <u>red</u>, the eclipse will not be detectible to the naked eye. This includes both the western United States and the southeastern states from Florida to the Carolinas. In these areas, 
        even if there are no clouds, the sky will not look different. In the areas that are colored <u>yellow</u>, slight changes in the sky color may be detectible to the naked eye during the eclipse.
        In these areas from Texas to Michigan, New York, and Maine, the sky may appear anywhere from slightly washed out in color to slightly dimmer than normal. In the areas that 
        are colored <u>green</u>, the sky will actually become dark during the peak of the eclipse. This thin strip from central Texas to western New York will experience a few moments
        of night-like conditions. If skies are clear, some stars will be visible and if skies are cloudy, it will still be dark.

        <h2 style="color:red">How can I see the eclipse?</h2>
        answer
        <h2 style="color:red">Will there be clouds?</h2>
        It is too early to forecast which places will experience cloudy skies on eclipse day. However, based on the past 50 years, we can identify the regions that are most likely to experiences 
        cloudy skies during the eclipse. In the US, the Pacific Northwest, the northern Plains, and northern New York and New England typically experience the cloudies conditions on April 8th. Historically, 
        these areas average more than 75% cloud cover.
