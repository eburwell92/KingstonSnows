            <span style="color:black"><b>Chance -</b></span> the mathematical probability of an event occurring. Chance may be expressed as a number, such as 50%, or may be expressed 
            as a corresponding quality, such as a "low chance". 
            <br><br>
            <span style="color:black"><b>Impact -</b></span>  refers to how a particular event affects daily routines. For example, snow flurries have very little affect on most people's
            daily routine (little impact); a blizzard will significantly affect everyone's daily routine (high impact). 
            <br><br>
            <span style="color:black"><b>Threat or Hazard -</b></span>  an event or weather condition that may affect daily routines. 
            <br><br>
            <span style="color:black"><b>Risk Level -</b></span>  a combination of chance and impact used to express how dangerous a future hazard will be. For example, blizzards are 
            high-impact events; however, if one blizzard has a 30% (low) chance of occurring while another blizzard has a 70% (high) chance of 
            occurring the threats they pose are not the same. While both will have high impacts if they occur, the 70% chance blizzard has a 
            higher probability of actually occurring, so it poses a greater level of risk.

             The "Snow Risk" graphic is used to map the winter weather areas that KingstonSnows is currently monitoring. If any potential 
             winter weather areas are currently being monitored, they will be indicated by a colored oval on the map labeled as "Area 1", 
             "Area 2", "Area 3", etc depending on how many there are. This oval outlines the storm's current extent. An arrow beside the 
             oval indicates the direction that the storm is expected to move once it forms. The color of the oval depicts the current risk 
             level for the Mid-Hudson Valley, which is represented by the purple <span style="color:#FC00FF"><b>X</b></span>. The threat level is a 
             combination of the probability of the storm affecting us, and the impact that it would have if it did affect us. The "Snow Risk" 
             graphic is intended to be used in conjunction with the info boxes located below them. These info boxes provide basic information 
             about the areas being monitored:

           <p>
             Each area being monitored will have its own info box. The colors and risk levels in the info boxes and on the map are the 
             same. Individuals with colorblindness can read the risk level for each area from the info boxes.

             The "Quick Outlook" graphic is used to display the chance of experiencing each hazard over the next several days. To use this 
             graphic, locate the "threat" column on the left, and then select an element in that column (ex: rain, snow, windy). Then, move across the row to 
             the right of the threat. The day/date at the top of the new column tells what timeframe the information is for. There are five 
             chance levels on this graphic, ranging from "very low" to "very high". Each level corresponds to roughly to the numerical probability 
             of experiencing the threat, that is, "very low" is less than 20%, "low" is about 20% to 40%, "Medium" is about 40% to 60%, "high" is 
             about 60% to 80%, and "very high" is more than 80%. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 correspond to each color and chance level, and are 
             to assist individuals with colorblindness in using the graphic.

             The "Snow Gauge" graphic is used to display both the amount of snow that is expected and the uncertainty in the snowfall forecast. 
             The dark blue section of the gauge illustrates the "extreme range" of snowfall that may occur in either the snowiest scenario possible
             or the least snowy possible. At it's low end, the extreme range corresponds to roughly the amount of snow that there is a 90% chance of exceeding. 
             At it's high end, the extreme range corresponds to roughly the amount of snow that there is a 10% chance of exceeding. The light blue section
             of the gauge illustrates the "likely range" of snowfall for the storm. At it's low end, the likely range" corresponds to the amount of snow 
             that there is a 75% chance of exceeding, and at it's high end, the likely range corresponds to the amount of snow that there is a 25% chance of
             exceeding. The "forecast" value is the most likely total snowfall value for the storm.
