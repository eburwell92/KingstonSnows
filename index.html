      <p class="text"><span style="font-size:36px; color:red;"><br> 9:00PM Monday:</span><br><br>
With the first day of spring arriving next Thursday, this last full week of winter is set to end on a very springy note! This week will feature warm, dry weather before a decent rain moves in this weekend.
      </p>

      <p class="text"><span style="font-size: 20px; color:red">The Forecast:</span><br> 
Tuesday will likely be our warmest day in the past three months. It'll be a bit breezy, but with plenty of sunshine our temperatures will likely surge into mid to upper 60s. This would be the first time that the Mid Hudson Valley has warmed above 60Â°F since December 11th! Temperatures will be notably cooler on Wednesday, but will gradually build back up to the 60s by the weekend. Over an inch of moderate to potentially heavy rain is likely on Sunday. The rain will likely be accompanied by winds that could gust as high as 40 mph. 
      </p>
      
      <img src="20250310-ImpactActions.png" style="width:90%"> 
      
        <p class="text"><span style="font-size: 20px; color:red">The Impacts:</span><br> 
There will be three main impacts from this week's weather: risk of brush fires, risk of flooding, and risk of power outages. The warm, dry weather on Tuesday will increase the <span style="color:red">risk of wildfires</span> in the Hudson Valley. Ulster County is currently under a "Burn Ban" - Do not light any outdoor fires this week. Every year New York State sees numerous wildfires in the spring that start when the snow melts revealing dry dead wood and debris. Because of this, there is an annual Burn Ban from March 16th to May 15th. Between these dates no one in the state is allowed to burn brush or yard waste due because it can easily grow into an uncontrolled wildfire. This happened this past weekend when several brushfires developed across southern New York including a major one on Long Island. For this reason, yesterday the Governor declared that the annual Burn Ban would begin today and continue until May. Impacts will be very different this weekend. This weekend's potentially heavy rain and wind will bring the risk of <span style="color:red"> flooding and power outages</span>. Right now, widespread flooding is not likely, but there could be ponding of water in areas with poor drainage. As for the winds, again not expecting widespread power outages, but there could certainly be some especially in areas closer toward the Catskills.  
        </p>

      <p class="text"><span style="font-size: 20px; color:red">Action Items:</span><br> 
 With this week's weather there are a few actions that you can take to reduce the potential impacts. <span style="color:red">For the risk of brush fires:</span> don't start any outdoor fires and avoid using any kind of machinery or equiptment outside that could accidentally start a fire. If you see a fire, call 911 immediately. <span style="color:red">For the risk of flooding:</span> clear debris from any drain pipes, ditches, or storm drains around your home/neighborhood. <span style="color:red">For the risk of power outages:</span> plan out how you would adapt to losing electricity for a day. 
      </p>
