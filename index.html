      <p class="text">
        <span style="color:red; font-size:24px">The Forecast:</span><br>
        Tuesday's storm is currently organizing over Texas and Arkansas, and confidence in an impactful snow event continues to increase. As mentioned yesterday, 
        main source of uncertainty has been the eventual placement of a band of heavy snow over the region. Trends over the past 24 hours have been to have this
        swath of heavy snow closer to Ulster County. As a result, the confidence in heavier snow has increased. Expect steady snow from 4AM Tuesday to 4PM Tuesday. 
        Around 9 inches of snow is likely.

        <span style="color:red; font-size:24px">The Impacts:</span><br>
        This will be a plowable snow event for the region. Expect snow covered roads which will make travel hazardous to difficult on Tuesday. The snow will also be
        fairly wet - this will make shoveling difficult, but should be good if you're looking to make some snowmen or snowballs.

      <p class="text">
        In keeping with our very warm winter that I mentioned in last night's update, Poughkeepsie set a daily record high temperature of 59 degrees today, 
        beating the previoous record by 2 degrees. Not to be out-done, Albany also decided to get in on the warmth by reaching 60 degrees, topping their previus 
        record by a whopping 7 degrees. The Albany record was set 69 years ago. Warmth aside, all eyes on next week's snowstorm.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        Since the last update, confidence has increased for an impactful snow event Monday night into Tuesday. A coastal storm will develop and push a swath of 
        snow across New York. Snow is most likely between 12AM Tuesday and 4PM Tuesday. The main source of uncertainty is the placement of the heaviest snow in the
        swath. Currently, moderate accumulations of 4 to 9 inches are currently likely around Kingston. However, shifts in the eventual snow band placement could still
        result in higher or lower totals outside of that range. As it did overnight, the range of possibilities should continue to narrow over the next two days. Regardless
        of exact totals, it is becoming increasingly likely that travel on roads will be hazardous to difficult Monday night through Tuesday. School cancellations are 
        likely on Tuesday.

      <p><span style="font-size:36px; color:red;"><br> 10:45PM Friday Update</span></p>

      <p class="text">
        It has been a lackluster winter so far here in the Hudson Valley. So far this winter, Kingston has picked up about 14.5 inches of snow. This is 
        well below normal for this point in the year. The lack of snow has been due to warmer than normal temperatures. Since December 1st, the average
        temperature at the Dutchess County Airport has been 34.7Â°F. This ties for the third warmest start to winter since 1949, and is on par with the lack
        luster winters of 2012 and 2016. Both of those years also had strong El Nino weather patterns, and it is not surprising that the current El Nino
        has impacted this winter. This winter has also been the wettest since 1974 with just over 12 inches of precipitation having fallen - roughy 90% of this has been rain.

        <span style="color:red; font-size:24px">The Forecast:</span><br>
        With all that seasonal context said, a potential snow event currently poses a threat for early next week. Like the past several weeks, this weekend will be 
        relatively mild with temperatures approaching 50 degrees on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Normally afternoon temperatures this time of year should be in the 
        mid-30s. It'll be cloudy Saturday and Sunday, but should remain mainly dry. By Monday, a storm system that is currently over the northwestern US will be approaching 
        New York. Temperatures Monday are likely to reach the 40s during the afternoon before dropping to near 30 after sunset. Currently, snow is likely to develop after 7PM 
        Monday. Snow is likely Monday night with temperatures remaining near 30. Snow Tuesday morning is likely to taper off by Tuesday afternoon. At this time, accumulating snow
        appears likely, however, it is too early for exact amounts. Dry and cooler weather is likely to linger through the end of next week. 
      </p>

       <p class="text">
        <span style="color:red; font-size:24px">The Impacts:</span><br>
        The impacts of next week's storm will depend on the track of the storm and how much snow eventually falls. That being said, some accumulating snow is currently likely
         between Monday night and Tuesday evening, impacting roadways. This timing, if it holds, is not likely to impact school classes on Monday, but may impact after school activities. This timing, 
         is also likely to result in school cancellations on Tuesday, or possibly school delays if the storm ends much faster than currently expected and only drops a limited amount of snow.
         Any lingering affects into Wednesday will depend on how much snow falls on Tuesday - currently, a very low chance of delays on Wednesday.
