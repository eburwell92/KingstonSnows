      <p class="text"><span style="font-size:36px; color:red;"><br>  Monday Update:</span><br><br>
Welcome to December! I am currently traveling internationally, so this will just be a quick update. As mentioned last Thursday, we could see some snowflakes this week. 

<br><br>

<span style="font-size:20px; color:red;"><br> The Forecast:</span><br>
Today and tomorrow will be dry but chilly with daytime temperatures reaching the upper 30s and nighttime lows falling to near 20 degrees. A weak storm will approach NY from Canada on Wednesday. This storm is likely to bring a quick round of <span style="color:red;"> snow showers </span>to the Mid Hudson Valley. Snow is most likely to fall for a couple of hours between <span style="color:red;">5PM Wednesday and 5AM Thursday</span>. There is the potential for a dusting to an inch of snow depending on how long it lasts. Temperatures will likely be near 30 degrees Wednesday night. 
<br>
<span style="font-size:20px; color:red;"><br> The Impacts:</span><br>
With temperatures near 30 degrees Wednesday night, snow should be able to stick to most surfaces. <span style="color:red;"> Slick roads </span> are possible Wednesday night into early Thursday morning. <span style="color:red;"> As for schools </span> - snow should begin falling late enough <span style="color:red;">on Wednesday</span> that early dismissals are not likely. Some schools may choose to cancel after school activities on Wednesday, especially in the Catskills, but class impacts are not expected. On <span style="color:red;"> Thursday, </span> delayed classes are possible across the region. If the snow ends earlier Wednesday night, delays will be less likely; if it ends later, delays will be more likely. 
<br><br>
Iâ€™ll still be traveling internationally with unpredictable internet access, but will try to have an update on Wednesday. <br>

      <p class="text"><span style="font-size:36px; color:red;"><br> 1:30AM Thursday:</span><br><br>
A Thanksgiving storm is currently moving across New York State producing rain and snow. The Catskills to our west will likely pick up a decent amount of wet snow, but here in the valley mainly rain is expected. After the storm ends later this evening, it will become much colder. As we head into the first week of December it will feel like winter. 
      </p>

      <p class="text">
<span style="font-size:20px;color:red">The Forecast:</span><br>
Rain will fall through most of the day today. About one inch of rain is likely. Similar to last week's storm, some wet snowflakes or sleet could fall briefly during the morning hours. Snow is not likely to stick in the Kingston area, but if it does, it will be limited to cars and maybe some grassy areas. Roads will just remain wet in the Kingston area, but could become slick as you head up to the Ashokan Reservoir areas. Slippery roads are expected in the Catskills due to accumulating snow. The storm should end by about 5PM today.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
<span style="color:red"> Next week will feel like winter. </span> After the storm ends, much temperatures will become much colder. Despite plenty of sunshine, daytime temperatures will struggle to reach 40 degrees. Overnight temperatures will fall to the low 20s and could even reach the teens. If you haven't done so yet, this weekend will be a great time to <span style="color:red"> dig out your winter coats </span> because you'll want them when its time to head back to work/school on Monday. Our <span style="color:red"> next shot at snow </span> may be next Thursday. However, this is far from certain because it would likely be a weak storm and is a full week away. If it were to occur, a quick round of light snow would be possible which could possibly impact schools depending on the specific timing. There are early hints that Thursday's possible snow could be followed by another opportunity for snow next weekend. That said, these are both still quite a ways away and we'll just focus on enjoying the holiday weekend for now.
