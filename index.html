     After an incredibly dry October and first half of November, our weather is finally changing. A strong storm will impact Ulster County Thursday into Friday. This storm will bring heavy rain to the entire region and accumulating snow in the Catskills. Here in Kingston, Thursday looks to be very wet while Friday could bring the first snowflakes of the season.

        <span style="font-size:20px;color:red">Thursday:</span><br>
        Rain all day. Definitely plan on wearing a raincoat or packing an unbrella on Thursday - if you have rain boots, it'll be a good day for those as well. Look for rain to begin before sunrise. Rain may fall heavily in the morning before lightening up but persisting through the evening hours. There is the potential for over an inch of rain to fall on Thursday. The last time that happened was back on on August 10th - over 100 days ago. It will be a chilly rain with temperatures only reaching the low to mid 40s. 
        <br><br><span style="font-size:20px;color:red">Friday:</span><br> 
        Thursday night will bring snow in the Catskills, but we are likely to see little more than rain or snow showers Thursday night into Friday here in the Kingston area. Temperatures look to fall to the mid-30s early Friday morning, this could be just cold enough to support a couple of hours of wet snowflakes around sunrsie. Right now, it is looking like temperatures will rebound to around 40 degrees during the day on Friday which would result in rain showers rather than snow showers. However, if temperatures remain a few degrees cooler than currently expected, then it would not be a complete surprise to see some snow showers during the day on Friday. Little or no snow accumulation is expected in Kingston.

        <br><br><span style="font-size:20px;color:red">Storm Impacts:</span><br> 
        Overall, impacts from this storm look to be relatively minor in the Kingston area. <span style="color:red">The heavy rain</span> Thursday morning is likely to create some substantial puddles. If you have any drainage pipes near you, it would be a good idea to check that they are not covered and clogged with leaves. Otherwise, flooding is not a concern because of how dry it has been lately. <span style="color:red">As for the snow</span> on Friday, up in the Catskills out past Phonecia sticky wet snow could result in damaged tree branches and some power outages. However, here in the Kingston area no impacts are currently expected. It would not be surprising to see the first snowflakes of the season, but roads are likely to be too warm for any snow to stick. If temperatures do trend a few degrees cooler resulting in a longer period of wet snowflakes, then a light coating (less than one inch) will be possible on grassy areas and cars. School cancellations or delays are possible in Ulster County school districts that are in the Catskills (Livingston Manor & Margaretville), but the chances of any impacts elsewhere are substantially lower.
