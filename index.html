      <p class="text">
        Only change since this afternoon has been some new data that suggests snow may not start before 8am or 9am. Otherwise, big picture remains unchanged. Light 
        snow remains likely during the day tomorrow, ending by 5PM. Light accumulations of 0 to 1 inch remain possible. 
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        School-wise, cancellations are not likely due to combination of the relatively late onset time of any snow that is now likely and the light nature of the snow. 
        However, early dismissals remain possible due to very cold temperatures allowing any snow to stick to roadways, despite light snow amounts. Roads are at greatest
        risk of being slippery after noon tomorrow.

      <p class="text"> 
        There have been no significant changes to the forecast since yesterday. A storm system will approach New York from the south and west tonight. This storm remains likely to produce 
        light snow across southern New York on Friday. The steadiest snow will be to our south over New York City and Long Island. Here in the Mid-Hudson Valley, 
        we will be on the northern fringe of the storm, so snow totals of 0 to 1 inch remain likely. The most likely timing for any snow remais between 7AM Friday and 5PM Friday.
      </p>
      <img src="20240118-snowgauge.png" class="graphic">
      <p class="text">
        While any snow will be light on Friday with snow totals likely limited to 0 to 1 inch, temperatures will be well below freezing. This will allow any snow to stick to all surfaces, including roads. Roads
        will be driveable, but the could easily become slippery, particularly during the afternoon. For this reason, early dismissals are possible on Friday. I'll have a brief update by 10PM tonight.

      <p><span style="font-size:36px; color:red;"><br> 5:00PM Wednesday Update</span></p>

      <p class="text">
       So far this week has brought us the coldest air of the season along with a decent dose of snow. The wintry week will continue to live up to 
        mid-January expectations with more snow and cold before the week is over.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
      <span style="font-size:24px; color:red">The Forecast:</span><br>
      Tonight will feature another round of frigid air as temperatures fall to near single digits. A weak disturbance will ripple through the region tomorrow.
        This will result in flurries and light snow showers tomorrow afternoon across northern New York and into parts of the Catskills. Here in Kingston, can't 
        rule out some flurries or a passing snow shower during the afternoon. No snow accumulation is expected, but a light dusting will be possible in areas where
        snow showers do occur. A second, more potent, storm system will move through on Friday. This second system will produce light snow across much of the 
        region, including here in the Kingston area. Currently in Kingston, the most likely start time for any snow is around 7AM Friday. Light snow will be possible 
        throughout the day with an inch or so likely by afternoon. After snow tapers off Friday evening, the weekend will feature dry weather but with temperatures 
        remaining in the 20s during the daytime and near the single digits overnight.

      <span style="font-size:24px; color:red">The Impacts:</span><br>
      Travel and school impacts are likely before the end of the week due to snow. <span style="color:red">Thursday:</span> Light snow showers on Thursday may result in slippery roads out toward the 
      Catskills in the afternoon. However, snow showers will have difficulty making it over the mountains, so no more than possibly a light dusting of snow is expected in
      the Hudson Valley. School districts in the far western parts of Ulster County, such as Margaretville or Livingston Manor,
      may issue early dismissals tomorrow; however, school impacts are not likely in Kingston on Thursday. <span style="color:red">Friday:</span> Light snow on Friday is expected
        to stick to all surfaces, including roads. Slick roads are expected late Friday morning though Friday afternoon across all of Ulster County. Travel will be possible, 
        but it will be hazardous. County-wide cancellations or early dismissals are currently likely on Friday. The main determining factor will be based on the ultimate snow start time.
