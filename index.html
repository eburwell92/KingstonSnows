        <span style="color:red; font-size:24px">Overview:</span><br>
        July 4th may have been yesterday, but local Independece Day celebrations are continuing into this weekend. From fireworks in Windham to the parade in Phoneicia, 
         this weekend will provide plenty of opportunities to get outside and enjoy our Hudson Valley communities. That being said, there will be active weather this weekend 
         that should be noted as you make your personal plans. Hot temperatures and possible storms will impact Saturday, so continue reading the latest forecast so you can plan accordingly.

        <span style="color:black; font-size:30px">The Forecast:</span><br>
        <hr style="border-top: 3px dotted #bbb">
        A heat advisory is in effect for Eastern Ulster County until 8PM Saturday. 
        <br> Saturday - hot and humid; morning low temperature of XX, afternoon high temperature of XX. Humidity may make temperatures feel as hot as XX. 
        <br> Sunday - forecast goes here
        <br><br>
        As of 3PM, current radar reveals a weather system to our west, near Michigan. Radar, satellite, and analysis from the Weather Prediction Center currently indicate
        that the cold front associated with this weather system is triggering a sprawling arc of storms that currently extends from Michigan, into the southeastern states, and back across Texas. 
        Over the next 24 hours, the cold front will approach our region. A southerly airflow ahead of the front will lead to increasing moisture on Saturday. This is evident through dewpoints that
        will increase to the mid-70s and precipital water values increasing to just over 2 inches, these values are <a href="https://www.weather.gov/lmrfc/climate_precipitable_water_climatology" >
          higher than 99%</a> of all July days. Both of these values are indicative of very moist, muggy air. Both computer modeling and extrapolation suggest that the moisture associated with the
        storm will begin to trigger rain
        tomorrow morning. The most likely timing for any precipitation will be between 4AM and 9AM. Steady rain is likely during this time, followed by a chance of scattered showers and
        thunderstorms throughout the afternoon. Rainfall totals of 0.25 to 0.50 inches are likley with isolated areas of up to 1.5 inches where stronger storms develop. The Weather Prediction Center
        has highlighted eastern New York
        as having a marginal risk of excessive rainfall throughout the day tomorrow. This means that there is a low, but higher than normal chance, that heavy rainfall

        <span style="color:red; font-size:24">Rain and flooding. </span>
        <br>With the chance of scattered heavier downpours tomorrow, there is a chance for areas of flooding. The <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/excessive_rainfall_outlook_ero.php"> Weather Prediction Center </a> has highlighted eastern New York as having
        a marginal risk of excessive rainfall throughout the day tomorrow. This means that there is a low, but higher than normal, chance that heavy rainfall could result in areas of flash flooding. 
        <a href=https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/para/para_images/ERO_Categories.png">In their words</a>, isolated flash flooding is possible. Any flash flooding is likely to be localized and primarily
        affect places that can experience rapid runoff with heavy rainfall.
