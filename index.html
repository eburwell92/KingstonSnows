        <br> Today's recap: <br>
        Today was by all standards a hot, muggy day. As <a href="https://kingstonsnows.com/zArchive-20240705-1645.html">forecasted yesterday</a>, rain moved across New York early this 
        morning with 0.33 inches to 0.84 inches reported between 5AM and 8AM at NYSMesonet stations in the 
        mid-Hudson Valley. Clouds associated with the morning batch of rain did clear out faster than anticipated. This allowed for ample sunshine throughout the
        day which boosted temperatures a few degrees higher than initially anticipated. Nearly every NYSMesonet station in the Hudson Valley from Lake Champlain to New York City recorded
        maximum temperatures between 89 and 91. This combined with dewpoints in the mid-70s to produce heat indexes as high as the lower 100s across eastern New York. The concern for strong 
        thunderstorms noted in yesterday's forecast also verified today. Storms this morning and scattered thunderstorms this afternoon intensified quite a bit. The National Weather Service
        in Albany shared 12 <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSAlbany/status/1809724653885354380">Special Weather Statements</a> on their Twitter today, highlighting individual storms that had 
        the potential to produce strong winds or hail. The Storm Prediction Center also upgraded our region to a <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSSPC/status/1809565753508815248">marginal 
        risk</a> of severe weather today and noted the <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSSPC/status/1809707427547459745">potential for supercells</a> in their discussion. Turning our 
        attention ahead to the upcoming work week, the stormy weather will pause for a few days while the July heat persists.

        <br><br>
        As of 8PM, much of the thunderstorm activity has shifted east of our region and current satellite reveals mostly clear skies. Weather Prediction Center analysis currently identifies
        a 1017 high pressure area over the midwest. The high pressure system will shift eastward and be directly over New York Sunday into Monday as depicted by both the 18z NAM and HRRR. 
        This will suppress cloud cover for the next two days and result in drier weather without rain. Thanks in part to ample sunshine, temperatures will remain hot reaching the low to mid 
        90s Sunday and Monday afternoons - about 10 degrees above normal for early July. Overnight lows will also run about 10 degrees above normal, falling to near 70. latest GEFS members 
        all have Poughkeepsie in the 91F - 94F range both Sunday and Monday, which is in line with deterministic output from the 18z HRRRR. While the "cold" front that moved through today 
        won't actually affect our temperatures much, it will usher in drier air behind it. Dewpoints tomorrow look to be limited to the mid-60s, opposed to today's mid-70s. This will allow 
        Sunday and Monday to feel less muggy, though heat indexes may still reach the mid-90s on Sunday and near 100 on Monday. Increased moisture may creep into the region Tuesday, 
        introducing the potential for isolated showers, as the high pressure area shifts to our east.

        <span style="color:red; font-size:24px">Dangerous heat.</span>
        <br>Warm temperatures will combine with moist air tomorrow to produce dangerous heat. The National Weather Service in Albany has issued a <a href="https://www.weatherusa.net/wxwarnings?id=147758950">heat advisory</a> for the mid-Hudson Valley. 
        The heat advisory is in place from 1PM to 8PM Saturday for temperatures that may feel has hot as 97 degrees. The advisory means that hot temperatures and high humidity may cause heat illnesses. The latest National Weather Service 
        <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/heatrisk/"> HeatRisk </a> index
        currently depicts portions of the mid-Hudson Valley experiencing major heat impacts on Saturday. The index factors in how unusual the heat is for the time of year, its duration and intensity, and its potential
        impact on human health. Major heat impact means that heat affects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration.

        Despite the rain and the heat tomorrow, I truly hope that everyone is able to have a safe, enjoyable holiday weekend!
